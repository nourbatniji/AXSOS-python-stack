    >>> first_book.authors.add(first_author)
    >>> second_book.authors.add(first_author)


7. Assign the second author to the first 3 books
    >>> second_author = Author.objects.get(id=2)
    >>> second_author.books.add(Book.objects.get(id=1))
    >>> second_author.books.add(Book.objects.get(id=2))
    >>> second_author.books.add(Book.objects.get(id=3))


8. Assign the third author to the first 4 books
    >>> third_author = Author.objects.get(id=3)
    >>> third_author.books.add(Book.objects.get(id=1))
    >>> third_author.books.add(Book.objects.get(id=2))
    >>> third_author.books.add(Book.objects.get(id=3))
    >>> third_author.books.add(Book.objects.get(id=6))


9. Assign the fourth author to the first 5 books (or in other words, all the books)
    f>>> ourth_author = Author.objects.get(id=4)
    >>> all_books = Book.objects.all()
    >>> for book in all_books:
            fourth_author.books.add(book)


    
10. Retrieve all the authors for the 3rd book
    >>> third_book = Book.objects.get(id=2)
    >>> for author in third_book.authors.all():
            print(author.first_name)

    Emily
    Fyodor
    Bill
                
        
11. Remove the first author of the 3rd book                   *****************
    >>> first_author_third_book = Author.objects.get(id=2)
    >>> third_book = Book.objects.get(id=3)
    >>> third_book.authors.remove(first_author)
        
        
12. Add the 5th author as one of the authors of the 2nd book
    >>> second_book = Book.objects.get(id=2)
    >>> fifth_author = Author.objects.get(id=5)
    >>> second_book.authors.add(fifth_author)


        
        
13. Find all the books that the 3rd author is part of
    >>> third_author.books.all()
    <QuerySet [<Book: Book object (1)>, <Book: Book object (2)>, <Book: Book object (3)>, <Book: Book object (4)>]>
        
        
14. Find all the authors that contributed to the 5th book
    >>> fifth_book = Book.objects.get(id=6)
